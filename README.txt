This site was created by Caleb Milligan for the Olympia Robotics Federation 2016 season,
and is specifically written to track the FIRST Stronghold game. However, modularity was
a key factor in designing the site, and many of the components may be recycled for future
implementations.

I've tried to provide detailed information on how various components work, but the
documentation may be vague or incomplete. If, having attempted to trace the code, you
still cannot understand how a particular component works, you may contact me by one of
the following email addresses:

Best of luck,
